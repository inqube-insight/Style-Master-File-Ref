## Updating SMV against Product ID

If there is a requirement for the same Style to have multiple SMVs based on Sizes or due to any other reason, then SMV can be updated at a Product ID level instead.

To update SMVs against Product ID

1.  On the Product List tab, update the 'SMV Level' field to reflect as 'Product ID'
2.  Any Product ID with 'SMV Level' updated as Product ID will reflect on the IE tab separately, allowing to update the SMV at a Product ID level, instead of at a Style level
